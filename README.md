'CD2' can be 'CD 2', with the number being any number. 'Disc 1' can be 'Disc1' and any number.  SOURCE FOLDER = D:\MUSIC\ARTIST\ALBUM - CD2 will be renamed to NEW FOLDER = D:\MUSIC\ARTIST\ALBUM\CD2  SOURCE FOLDER = D:\MUSIC\ARTIST\ALBUM - Disc 1 will be renamed to NEW FOLDER = D:\MUSIC\ARTIST\ALBUM\Disc 1  Text can exist after 'CD' or 'Disc'.
